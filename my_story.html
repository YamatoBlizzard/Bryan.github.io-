			<h2>Who is Bryan?</h2>
				<p>Hello my name is Bryan. I am 19 years old and this is my first time creating a website. I have no interesting hobbies as I sit at home playing games that I enjoy. The only type of message I check is whatsapp and Facebook messanger. I still have no idea what I will be in the future sadly, so don't asked. Don't know if I am doing the right work but hey, at least I am doing something. I am also lost on how to do css, this few paragraphs are bad. Honestly what am I doing????</p>

			<h2>How I was able to become a tournament player and the journey I have taken.</h2>

			<h3>The begining</h3>
				<p>I played games almost everyday and there was one game that I was really good at. The game was known as Heroes of the Storm(Hots) for short.</p>

				<p>Heroes of the storm is a type of MOBA(Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) that focuses on teamwork over individual skill of the player. This is a special type of MOBA that rewards team with shared xp, meaning that you and your team are the same level. Unlike Dota, Hots replace buying items to talent builds. Talent are use to upgrade your skill abilities and your passive abilities. If the enemy team is donimating your team there is a handicap, if your team kills a enemy team hero, you and your teammates gain alot more xp value then the winning team.</p>

				<p>One day I was approach by one of my online friends to take part of a tournament. I said yes I'll try it and see how it goes. My team was from Thailand and sometimes communication can be confusing sometimes, but we manage to play fine as we played Hots for months together without comunicating. A week later I was also ask to join a Malaysian team and I said yeah I'll give it a try. During the miss communication and stupidity of my part, I join the Malaysian team by accident and the Thai team was slightly mad by me. After a few days joining the team I got kicked, why?(Because the Captain was too passionate about winning he kicked the weakest link)</p>

				<p>Shortly after I was kicked I was irritated and asked the Thai team to let me in the team again. Due to my recent abandon to the team I thought I could not join them again so I had little hope and waited for a no. To my surprise I was welcomed back into the team and I was delited.</p>

			<h3>The First Step</h3>
				<p>There will be 8 teams in total that will play against another at the SEA region. There was the Phillipines, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia that will be playing against in SEA. Before the SEA region start each of the countrys must fight against another to be represented. We needed to make it to the top 2 to go to the next round. We did alot scrimming(Tournament teams asking to play against players not from the tournament to improve and create new combos) and the next thing I knew the tournament was tommorow. Since I was part of a Thai team I had to fly over to Bankok to take part in the tournament.</p>

				<p>We played and won the first round however or second match was against the current Thai champions, so we lost horribly. Now we were at the losers bracket where we could push our way up again but it would be hard as the winning bracket has 1 point(say if you were to play a best of 3 and in the winning bracket then you only need to win 1 game to make it 2-0). We managed to push our way up and we needed 1 more win to secure the top 2. However the last team we had to face was the Thai champion again. Half of my team was panicking and the other half was thinking of a plan. It was 2-2 and the last game was tensed. I normally don't care for alot of things so this doesn't bother me but when I looked at my teammates they we mentally exhausted. However the last map the Thai champions made a fatal mistake and we manage to win because of it. Everyone there who was watching us was shocked and we managed to get second place and will be going to the SEA region tournament. My teammates were shouting with joy while the champions showed sportmenship.</p>

				<p>The SEA region tournament is gonna be next week so I had to fly back to Thailand again. The next day i arrived back home and watch the Malaysian team. However the team I joined was not there for some reason. I asked one of my online friend, who was part of the team, told me that the Captain didn't give the money they won in the qulifiying round. So the whole team decide to not take part in the tournament. Karma's a bitch.</p>

				<p>I flew back to Thailand and we had this kind of photoshoot that we need to take. We didn't have time to rest as there was cameramen recording and we were asked to do a short introduction video. There was also goodie bags and lucky draw there, so family members can have fun while watching us play. However my team knew we were the weakest team in the tournament, so we decide to play for fun as we get some money anyway.</p>

			<h3>The Summer Championship</h3>
				<p>After a few weeks after the Spring tournament, I told my dad that there was another tournament coming up soon. So he decided to create a brand new team. He created the team as he wanted to try the role and get experience. My dad found and recuited players from the Facebook community and asked me if I knew them. Because I knew a few of them I told my dad which player is the best for playing a specific hero. We recuited 3 new members and 1 of the new members was from indonesia. We needed to find another 2 to make it a 5 to take part in the Summer tournament, but one of our members knows 2 players that was finding a team. So we got a full team.</p>

				<p>After we had finished making the team, shortly after we played and scrimed together. We talked about startegy and combos that people least expect. Two weeks before the tournament we decided to meet in person next week so that we could play together as a team. Since the tournament is in Malaysia, one of our members needed to fly here. After picking him up from the airport, we had lunch together with the team and went straight to the cybercafe.</p>

				<p>The tounament started today and some of our teammates was nervous. However my dad told them to clam down until this is over. Since we know who are the strong players there, we wanted to avoid 2 teams to play against. After seeing the bracket, we were not fight them until the finals, so we were relived. After destroying teams that we never heard of, we made it to the finals. Our last opponent was a team that we could take on easily as they beat the 2nd strongest team.</p>

				<p>We were wrong. It was a hard and stressful fight for our team. Since I don't care about winning or losing I just continue playing and remained calm. As the game was 2-2, final point takes all, and 1 misplay mean gameover. The situation was tensed as I heared my team going alot more defensive. As we prepared for the final teamfight, which is the make or break point, we fought. Both teams was panicking for the way they play their hero but still make smart decisions. When one of my teammates died, so did one from the enemy. A second later the captain decide to go offensive and called us to dive. I thought it was a stupid idea but I went for it anyway. We lost one and another until we had 2 members on the field. However the enemy was low and we managed to wipe them out. We did a big minion push straight after and we manage to take a win.</p>

				<p>My team shouted and screamed as they have accomplish Champions. We were happing and showed sportmenship to the other. Some return back the good game while some simply ignore us. We had a celebration feast and talked about it until tommorow. The next day we brought my teammate to the airport to return home and the Summer Championship was over. Unlike spring tournament there was no other tournament for this so it was over. As we are number 1 in Malaysia we also have real life. As 1 of my teammates to study aboard, another wants to retire and the team now incomplete once more.</p>

			<h3>The Fall Championship</h3>
				<p>With only 2 of us in the team, I didn't really care that much so I went on my day as normal. A few day later my teammates asked if I wanted to take part in the Fall Championship. I said "Yea but we have so little members in the team". I told my dad about it and he tried to find new members. One day to our surprise, we had one of the captain from Phillipines. He played every tournament and got no.1 in the SEA region tournament. He even went to the headquaters in the US a year ago for the tournament. We were lucky. The Fall tournament is different as we had the chance of going to the US headquaters to play if we won the SEA region.</p>

				<p>My dad found another player and I also tried asking around. I asked one of my online friends if they wanna join our team. He was hesitant at first, as he was from the team in spring that didn't take part. After a few convincing he agreed to join. And once again the team was whole.</p>

				<p>We could almost never scrim most of the time as we had no time, because different people has things to do. This time we had 2 from overseas so they had to come to Malaysia. A week before the tournament we practiced as a team and understand one another. In the qualifiying round there was no team that we can take on. But there is one team who can make things challenging. It was the same team I fought against in the Summer tournament. 2 of our members were nervous but we manage keep them calm, for now. We played and won against them so we were in the winners bracket so we weren't to worried. But we knew we had a chance to fight them in the finals if they push through. two hours has passed and we were watching the 2 teams that was gonna be our next opponent. The other team was winning and the next teamfight is gonna be the last, that will determine the victors. Most people there they couldn't tell the difference, but for us that has play the games for hours and hours we could tell just by looking at it. The other team, that we were cheering on, has mad a misplay. With that misplay the team, we were afraid to fight against won.</p>

				<p>The true test is about to begin and it is not gonna be an easy one. As we had the winners bracket we only need to win 1 time. With that in mind our Captain was full of hope while others are nervous. One was thinking how to counter their hero picks, another tries to calm himself as he looks like his life was endanger. As the other other team is in the losers bracket they can pick the map they want to play in. They choose their strongest map that they mastered for hours, while we as a team has little exprience on that map. Tension increased for one of our member and we needed to calm him down. He managed to calm down but not for very long as we started the match.</p>

				<p>We played and 15 minutes into the game, we were losing. A push big minion push from the bottom lane and our core is about to be destroyed. We knew if we can't defend it, it was over. However due to pressure and victory within their grasp, they were impatient and mad a mistake. We capatilize on that moment and manage to defend. But the game was far from over as we have also made their core very low. With the next objective being actavated shortly, it is going to be matchgame for us. We had little time to think as either the enemy or our cores will be destroyed if one of our team or enemy gets it. Two objectives spawn next to each other and both teams played offensive and defensive. We got a pick and try to push the enemy away. Another enemy died before getting rid of 2 of our. Another traded blows and now it's 2 to 2 on the field. With alot of pressure from the enemy team, they were impatient. With that I manage to wipe them with my ally and took the win.</p>

				<p>Before even finishing the game my teammates yelled and scream with joy. One of them was even crying as he never thought he would get this far. I was confused as I thought 2 team will fight at the SEA region, but my dad told me there was only 1 spot. I was surprised and it really didn't bother me as it was already over. With cheer from my teammates we needed to show sportmenship. When we look at our opponents they were really really down. We decide not to go there as they needed some space. After a long day we had a big feast once more and talked about what was going on. We are now the top 4 in the whole of SEA and we need to prepare in the next 2 weeks as that is gonna take place in Thailand.</p>

			<h3>The Pride of Gamers</h3>
				<p>We packed our equipment and were ready to travel to Thailand. Once we touchdown, there was a camera crew waiting for us. They have done doing the introduction video and we were the last one. After that we went to a hotel next to the stadium we were gonna play and it was cool. Once we put our things down we went to the stadium and set up our equipment to test if it's working.</p>


				<p>We didn't have any time to explore as there was alot of recordings and photoshoots. If you wanna cringe or watch the video click <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlizzHeroesSEA/videos/649808631861122/" target="_blank">here</a> to watch it. Anyway after the  photoshoot and recordings are done we immidiately started scrimming and before I knew it, it was tommorow. </p>

				<p>Our team knew we can't win but we knew we could beat the Thai team. However our Captain feels like we can take them all on and make it into the finals. But another member complain and stated the odvious. As our Captain is full of hope our teammates are doubtful. We played our first match and lost miserably. Our team full of frustration as they had miscommunication and arguements. The 2 fight against another and I knew we have lost this tournament. The Captain, trust alot in me, told me that he knew that this isn't gonna work and we are going to lose the next game. </p>

				<p>As the second match was finished we were going to fight the Thais. After the arguement one of our members was full of hope that we could win against them. As 2 members were still tilted at each other our captain choose weak hero choice. It was a rollercoaster as we fight and wipe them, the next teamfight they wipe up and the process continues. After a horrible teamfight for us we were gonna lose. I accepted the lost and was happy to get it over with. However the one who was full with pride and hope to win, leaves the game a few seconds early before it even finished. The whole world was watching and was commenting how that was bad sportmenship.</p>

				<p>We tried to talk reason with him but he wouldn't listen. We didn't see him after awhile but eventuallu he return. My dad scolded him for that was really really bad for us as our reputation for the country is being represented. After the lost we return to the hotel and got ready to return home.</p>

			<h3>End of the Road</h3>
				<p>Once that was all over, I carried on playing and continue my life. The next year I heard of more price money gonna be in next tournament. I was asked to try out a team and I said yes. However when i play with my friends i could see how they play. Some now plays seriously and that was scary. Once that was over I decided not to play for tournaments any longer. I join the team so that we could have fun while playing together and that have changed. Now there is more pressure then every before and more countried going to be in the tournament</p>
